This Plugin for MuseScore is derived from the [Note Names plugin].
It will look at the current key signature and for each note list it's interval based on the Ionian mode of the key.

To use the plugin, you must first install it according to the [instructions in the Handbook](http://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins "Handbook").

The idea for this plugin stems from a [discussion in the forum](http://musescore.org/en/node/16786), the microtonal extension from [another discussion in the forum](http://musescore.org/en/node/16870).
